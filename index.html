        <p>Understand the basic syntax rules of C# programming. Learn about statements, expressions, and code structure.
        </p>
        <p>Understanding the basic syntax rules of C# programming is essential for writing effective and readable code.
          In this section, we'll cover key concepts such as statements, expressions, and the general structure of C#
          code.</p>
        <h2>Statements and Expressions</h2>
        <p>Statements: In C#, statements are individual instructions that perform actions. They are typically terminated
          by a semicolon (;). Examples of statements include variable declarations, assignments, method calls, loops,
          and conditional statements.</p>
        <pre> <code>
           int x = 10; // Variable declaration and assignment
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); // Method call
</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Expressions:</strong> Expressions are combinations of operators, operands, and variables that produce
          a value. They can be used within statements to perform calculations, make comparisons, and more.</p>
        <pre><code>int sum = 5 + 3; // Expression that calculates sum
bool isTrue = sum > 7; // Expression that evaluates a comparison
</code></pre>

      <header>C# Output</header>
      <article>
        <p>Explore various ways to output information to the console or other output streams in C#. Print text and data
          to the screen using different methods</p>
        <p>Outputting information in C# is essential for communicating with users and displaying results. You can print
          text and data to the screen using various methods and techniques. Let's explore some of the ways to achieve
          this.</p>
        <h2>Using Console.WriteLine()</h2>
        <p>The `Console.WriteLine()` method is a common way to output text to the console. It adds a newline character
          after the output.</p>
        <pre> <code>
          Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
           </code></pre>
        <p>You can also use placeholders to format output with variables:</p>
        <pre>  <code>string name = "Alice";
int age = 30;
Console.WriteLine("Name: {0}, Age: {1}", name, age);
</code></pre>
        <h2>Using Console.Write()</h2>
        <p>The Console.Write() method is similar to Console.WriteLine(), but it doesn't add a newline character. It's
          useful when you want to print multiple items on the same line.</p>
        <pre>   <code>Console.Write("Hello, ");
Console.Write("World!");
</code></pre>
        <h2>Formatting Output</h2>
        <p>You can use string interpolation to include variable values directly within a string:</p>
        <pre> <code>string name = "Bob";
Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}!");
</code></pre>
        <h2>Special Characters</h2>
        <p>You can use escape sequences to display special characters:</p>
        <pre> <code>Console.WriteLine("First line\nSecond line");
Console.WriteLine("Tab:\tTabbed text");
Console.WriteLine("Quote:\'Single quotes\'");
       </code></pre>
        <h2>Concatenation</h2>
        <p>You can concatenate strings and variables using the `+` operator:</p>
        <pre><code>string greeting = "Hello, ";
string target = "You!";
Console.WriteLine(greeting + target);
</code></pre>
        <h1>Using Composite Formatting</h1>
        <p>You can use the String.Format() method to format output with placeholders:</p>
        <pre>  <code>string name = "Eve";
int score = 85;
string message = String.Format("Player: {0}, Score: {1}", name, score);
Console.WriteLine(message);
</code></pre>
        <h2>Using String Interpolation</h2>
        <p>String interpolation simplifies output formatting:</p>
        <pre> <code>double price = 19.99;
Console.WriteLine($"The price is {price:C2}");
</code></pre>
        <h2>Output Streams</h2>
        <p>Apart from the console, C# supports other output streams, such as files and network connections. You can use
          the StreamWriter class to write to files:</p>
        <pre>  <code>using System.IO;

string filePath = "output.txt";
using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(filePath))
{
    writer.WriteLine("This is written to a file.");
}
</code></pre>
        <p>In summary, C# offers multiple ways to output information. Whether you're printing to the console, formatting
          output, using different output methods, or working with files, understanding these techniques is crucial for
          effective communication in your programs.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="C#_Comments">
      <header>C# Comments</header>
      <article>
        <p>Discover how to add comments to your code. Comments are essential for making your code more understandable to
          yourself and others.</p>
        <p>Comments are an essential aspect of programming that help make your code more understandable to yourself and
          others. They provide explanations, clarifications, and context for the code you write. Let's explore how to
          add comments in C# and why they are crucial for effective code communication.</p>
        <h2>Single-Line Comments</h2>
        <p>Single-line comments are used to add explanations to a single line of code. Anything after `//` is considered
          a comment and is ignored by the compiler.</p>
        <pre><code>// This is a single-line comment
int age = 25; // This variable stores the user's age
</code></pre>
        <h2>Multi-Line Comments</h2>
        <p>Multi-line comments are used when you need to add explanations to multiple lines of code. Anything between
          `/*` and `*/` is treated as a comment block.</p>
        <pre> <code>/* This is a
   multi-line comment
   that spans multiple lines */
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
</code></pre>
        <h2>Documenting with XML Comments</h2>
        <p>XML comments are a special type of comment used for documenting code, especially for generating documentation
          using tools like Visual Studio's IntelliSense. They start with /// and can include descriptions, parameter
          details, return values, and more.</p>
        <pre> <code>/// <summary>
/// This method calculates the sum of two integers.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="a">The first integer.</param>
/// <param name="b">The second integer.</param>
/// <returns>The sum of the two integers.</returns>
int CalculateSum(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}
</code></pre>

        <h2>Importance of Comments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Code Understanding: Comments provide insights into the code's purpose, behavior, and logic, making it
            easier for you and others to understand the code's intent.</li>

          <li>Code Maintenance: Comments help when revisiting code after some time, ensuring that you can quickly
            understand what each part does and make modifications confidently.</li>

          <li>Collaboration: When working in a team, comments help other team members understand your code, leading to
            smoother collaboration and code integration.</li>

          <li>Documentation: Well-commented code can serve as living documentation, reducing the need for separate
            documentation files and helping newcomers understand your codebase.</li>

          <li>Debugging: Comments can highlight potential issues, reasons for specific decisions, or known bugs, aiding
            in debugging and problem-solving.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Commenting Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use clear and concise language.</li>
          <li>Comment the why, not just the how. Explain the reasons behind decisions.</li>
          <li>Avoid over-commenting obvious or self-explanatory code.</li>
          <li>Update comments when code changes to keep them accurate.</li>
          <li>Prioritize readability by using consistent formatting for comments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>conclusion, comments play a vital role in making your code more understandable, maintainable, and
          collaborative. By adding clear and meaningful comments, you enhance code quality and contribute to effective
          software development.</p>
